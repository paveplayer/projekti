    <p>2. by: thelittlesongbird imbd. A great show, despite declining in quality over the years
When I was 10, I adored the Simpsons, America's favourite dysfunctional family. Me and my brother and sisters watched it every day after school, and got a bagful of laughs. Two years ago though, I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny, creative or as original anymore. Well after seeing the Simpsons.  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/review/rw2188116/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_1_hd">sivun arvio</a></p>

Brilliant television series that could probably be best described as "The Flintstones" gone stark-raving mad. "The Simpsons", everyone knows them. Some love the series and some could care less about it. Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/review/rw0265254/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_hd">sivun arvio</a></p>

I was hesitant to give this the rating I did, but from reading other audience reviews, my review actually will come across as far more... lenient. What can I say that hasn't been said already, the golden age of The Simpsons (seasons 3-8) is flawless television. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/review/rw5637107/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_hd">sivun arvio</a> </p>

    <p>5. by:splintercell89 imbd. the absolute Best Cartoon ever!
Out of every cartoon, Movie, play, and T.v show I've ever seen The Simpsons tops it all. the Simpsons is the funniest show Bar None. American Dad, Futurama, and Family guy come in close but in my opinion the Simpsons is better than all of them combined. I have seen every single episode and i own seasons one through. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/review/rw1116198/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_hd">sivun arvio</a></p>
